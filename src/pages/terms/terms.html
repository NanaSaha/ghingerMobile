      mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked

      TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USING THE APP The App includes software
      provided by people other than the Company, and uses certain data that you
      provide to it in order to work • The App operates only on iPhone version
      4S or higher running iOS 10 or higher, or Android-enabled phones running
      Android v4.3 or higher. It requires a consistent 3G or faster data
      connection and does not operate reliably on GPRS or EDGE connections. • We
      recommend that if you are using a wireless network to access the App, you
      avoid use of public Wi-Fi facilities in favour of a personal Wi-Fi
      connection, and that the wireless network is secured with WPA-2 security.
      We recommend that the device from which you access the App is password
      protected, set to lock after a short period of inactivity, and protected
      with suitable anti-virus and anti-malware software. • From time to time,
      updates to the App may be made available to you. We recommend that you use
      the latest version of the App at all times, to take advantage of the
      latest enhancements. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use
      the Services until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of
      the App and accepted any new terms. Mobile Device Access We may request
      access or permission to certain features from your mobile device,
      including your mobile device’s calendar, camera, contacts, microphone,
      reminders, SMS messages, and other features. If you wish to change our

      AND OUR SERVICES Adults can use our services on behalf of children, but
      children shouldn't use our services themselves • Children under 16 may
      have an account opened for them by a parent or legal guardian, and if the
      parent or legal guardian supervises the child's use of our services at all
      times. • Young people between 16 and 18 may use our services and open
      their own account with us, but for our Private Service only if entitled to
      by their Partner membership or if an adult has agreed to use of their
      credit or debit card for the payment of Charges. • We may suspend services
      or terminate user accounts if we reasonably suspect that they are being
      used in breach of the restrictions. MEDICINES How medicines are prescribed
      to you • The General Medical Council registration number of all Ghinger
      doctors, past or present, can be supplied upon request. All doctors who
      have signed up to provide prescriptions through the Company's systems have
      undertaken to comply with the Ghana Medical Council Guidelines on remote
      prescribing, essential standards of quality and safety. • We do not
      provide prescriptions for controlled drugs. • The App may enable you to
      request that we send your prescription to a pharmacy near to you for you
      to collect during normal opening hours, or request that one of our
      affiliates fulfil the prescription and deliver the prescribed articles to
      you. • If you choose to have your prescription sent to a pharmacy that is
      near to your location, we will make reasonable attempts to contact that
      pharmacy and have the prescription sent to the chosen pharmacy within an
      hour. • We will use reasonable efforts to deliver the prescription to your
      device or to a nearby pharmacy promptly but we are not connected with and
      have no control over or responsibility for any individual pharmacy, their
      policies in relation to acceptance or otherwise of prescriptions, opening
      hours, cost or availability of medicines prescribed. There are a number of
      factors which may impact on which pharmacy is chosen and there can be no
      guarantee that a pharmacy to which the prescription is delivered (if that
      option is chosen) will be the nearest pharmacy. • If, within the App, you
      choose to order your prescription medication for delivery to you, it will
      be despatched by our partner dispensing chemist. The terms of delivery
      are: • we will use reasonable endeavours to procure the processing and
      despatch of your prescription within 4 business days where the medication
      is in stock; • the delivery time following despatch should typically not
      exceed 3 business days to areas within Accra but please note that in
      relation to delivery to remote locations, or internationally, that
      delivery time could be longer; • delivery fees are not displayed within
      the App at the time of the order - please note that the cost of medication
      is displayed; • delivery will be within the timescale selected in the app
      where possible; • medications are personal to the person for whom they are
      intended and therefore may not be returned and no refunds will be given
      for medications ordered once the order is placed; • set by our partner
      dispensing chemists, which includes price; • we or our partner dispensing
      chemist may refuse to fulfil an order where it considers the order not to
      be in the best interests of the person for whom it is intended or who has
      ordered it or may be illegal or contrary to any regulation or guideline; •
      if no one is available to take delivery of the order when delivery is
      first attempted, there may be a delay in delivery, and/or the recipient
      may have to follow the procedures of the relevant despatch company in
      order to collect the order, including picking it up from a depot; and •
      our partner dispensing chemists are not part of our organisation and, to
      the extent permitted by law, we disclaim responsibility for their acts and
      omissions. TESTING SERVICES We offer private testing services • Personal
      Doctor Service clients should discuss any necessary tests with their
      Personal Doctor which may be able to be offered. • The App can be used to
      order certain medical tests (" Tests"). These services are provided by a
      partner laboratory with which the Company has entered into arrangements
      for those services. • The partner laboratory is a separate entity from us
      and to the extent permitted by law we disclaim any liability for any acts
      or omissions of the partner laboratory. • By ordering any Tests, you agree
      to comply with any instructions provided in relation to the Tests
      including in relation to the booking and administration of Tests, receipt
      and provision of Test materials and samples (including delivery by post or
      attendance in person at Test facilities) and payment. • Subject to a range
      of factors including (without limitation) the nature of the relevant Test,
      your location and the availability of laboratories, the App may enable you
      to: • request the despatch, by post, of a Test to be administered
      (self-collected) by you and returned to the laboratory by post, with the
      results then analysed, sent to us and delivered to you through the App; •
      arrange an appointment to attend a Test centre for the Test to be
      undertaken, the results to be sent to us and delivered to you through the
      App; and • contact a Test centre, to enable you to arrange to undertake a
      Test independently and have the results sent to us to be delivered through
      the App. • You understand and acknowledge that prior to Test results being
      made available to you within the App, you may be requested to undertake
      and pay for an additional consultation with a Practitioner. • The prices
      will be displayed within the App and you agree to those at the time of
      ordering. Certain pathology services - for example, if you elect to
      contact a Test centre to undertake a Test independently - may incur
      charges in addition to those listed in the App and you acknowledge and
      agree that such additional fees as required may be payable. • If, within
      the App, you choose to order your Test for delivery to you and
      administration (self-collection) by you, it will be despatched by our
      partner laboratory. The terms of delivery shall be as follows: • we will
      use reasonable endeavours to procure the processing and despatch of your
      Test within 3 business days where the Test is in stock; • the delivery
      time following despatch should typically not exceed 3 business days but
      please note that in relation to delivery to remote locations that delivery
      time could be longer; • prices and delivery fees are not displayed within
      the App at the time of the order; • delivery will be either by express
      delivery or refrigerated express delivery, depending on the Test; • Tests
      are personal to the person for whom they are intended and therefore may
      not be returned and no refunds will be given for Tests ordered once the
      order is placed; • orders may be subject to a minimum price as displayed
      in the App; • we or our partner laboratory may refuse to fulfil an order
      where we consider the order not to be in the best interests of the person
      for whom it is intended or who has ordered it or may be illegal or
      contrary to any regulation or guideline; and • if no one is available to
      take delivery of the order when delivery is first attempted, there may be
      a delay in delivery, and/or the recipient may have to follow the
      procedures of the relevant despatch company in order to collect the order,
      including picking it up from a depot. • Processing time for a returned
      Test will vary depending on the Test but we will use reasonable endeavours
      to procure that the laboratory analyses the Test and returns results
      within 3-5 business days. Results will be delivered to you through the App
      and you explicitly consent to that by ordering through the App. • Tests to
      be administered at a drop in Test centre will be subject to the terms and
      conditions of that centre and the opening hours of that centre. • If you
      elect to arrange an appointment to attend a Test centre for the Test to be
      undertaken, or to contact a Test centre to enable you to arrange to
      undertake a Test independently, then we shall use reasonable efforts to
      assist you but cannot guarantee the availability of the services from the
      Test centre and is not liable for the acts or omissions of the Test
      centre. • The Company will use reasonable efforts to process any orders
      for Test services within 2 business days and the time limits set out above
      start running from the end of that processing period. • It may not be
      appropriate for some Tests to be self-administered, in which case they may
      not be available for delivery and must be conducted by a registered
      medical practitioner or nurse. OTHER LIMITS ON OUR SERVICE Other
      limitations and restrictions on the use of services • We do not guarantee
      the availability of any particular Practitioner at any particular time. We
      will do what we can to arrange a consultation with a Practitioner as soon
      as possible, but do not guarantee to offer consultations within a
      particular time. Consultations generally are limited to 10 minute
      durations with Practitioners and, if you use the Personal Doctor Service,
      20 minutes with specialist clinicians. • Other than for our Clinical
      Services, if you choose to submit details about your symptoms in the App,
      the information returned is on the basis of general healthcare information
      and not as personalised health advice for you. Where the information
